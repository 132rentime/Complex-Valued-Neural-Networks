## Symmetry Detection and Pattern Recognition Using Complex Value Neural Networks

In this paper, we apply the backpropagation algorithm on complex numbers. We show the potential computational power Complex-Valued Neural Networks possess by solving the classic XOR problem with a 2 layered complex-valued neural network which cannot be solved with a 2 layered realvalued neural network. 

The study also explores 4 different bit lengths in order to detect symmetry. The effect of the learning rate and mapping angle on the CVNN are investigated and it is observed that CVNN is a powerful tool for symmetry detection.

Below we see the Confusion Matrix for Symmetry Detection for a 3 Input 1 Output Network
